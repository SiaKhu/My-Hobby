        <p class="para">One of my hobbies is reading books in my free time. Usually at night before bed, I read books. Reading is a very good habit which can help with learning new things. Reading is also great as a pass-time activity if you are bored. Anyone can read, but I am naturally enthralled with books unlike some other people. Reading books keep people happy and busy. It is also a great source of entertainment and knowledge.
